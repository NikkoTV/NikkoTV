Q. What's with the New update ?<br>

A. Well as wehenever anything changes we always desired to be that perfect from old one so we are going to del <br>
some old channles/Groups and going to add New channels <br>

Q. What are to those channels ? are they free because i'm poor AF :(<br>

and ofcourse they are free and always will be until zombies attack (and yes we know you all are poor and so as we are)<br>

Q. why Nikko Stopped doing VC ?<br>
A. wtf bro we never stopped doing vc you all are welcome there at anytime <br>

Q. why Nikko don't give any credit to anyone ?<br>

A. well to be serious here as nikko is telegram based community and we do not stream any anime on website based server so as far there is no official channel<br> or community of anime on telegram we are not going to give any piece of credit to anyone as we all are pirates xD and there is nothing to do<br> about that here so if you ever come to our group for credits then we will just politily say you go and fuck yourself<br>

A. hmmmmm..... what was that again ? Lenore do we have a bot name like this ? are you serious ?<br>

well answer of this question depends on PirateMonkeyDLuffy as far he will reach bot API and tlib we will make <br>lenore a super group Managment bot for everyone and without Gban crap :) and now other fucking show off<br>

Q. From where can i access nikko all channels and groups ?<br>

A. simply jusy go to nikko.github.io or if you are in telegram go to @Tsushinmo (means network)<br>
